## Code of Conduct

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v9 or later) or Yarn (v1.22 or later)
- React Native CLI
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- CocoaPods (for iOS, macOS only)
- Watchman (recommended for macOS/Linux)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Fork the repository**
   Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page on GitHub.

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RightImpact.git
   cd RightImpact
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install
   
   # Or using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

4. **Install iOS dependencies (macOS only)**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy the example environment file and update the values as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Running the App

#### iOS

1. Start the Metro bundler:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, run the app on iOS:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   # or
   yarn ios
   ```

#### Android

1. Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected.

2. Start the Metro bundler (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

3. In a new terminal, run the app on Android:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   # or
   yarn android
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model:

- `main` - Production code (protected branch)
- `develop` - Integration branch for features (protected branch)
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfixes for production
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

**Example:**
```
feat(authentication): add login with Google

Add support for Google OAuth authentication.

Closes #123
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message.

3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```

4. Open a Pull Request to the `develop` branch.

5. Ensure all tests pass and your code is properly documented.

6. Request a code review from at least one maintainer.

7. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the `develop` branch.

## Code Style

We use:
- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type checking

Before committing, run:
```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Check TypeScript types
npm run type-check
```

## Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library for testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
- Add comments to your code where necessary.
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with notable changes.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically through CI/CD pipelines. The `main` branch is automatically deployed to production.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### iOS Build Fails
- Make sure you've run `pod install` in the `ios` directory
- Clean the build folder in Xcode (Product > Clean Build Folder)
- Delete the `ios/build` directory and try again

#### Android Build Fails
- Make sure you have the correct Android SDK installed
- Clean the project: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
- Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio

#### Metro Bundler Issues
- Stop the Metro bundler and remove the cache:
  ```bash
  npm start -- --reset-cache
  ```
- Or delete the Metro cache manually:
  ```bash
  rm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-* && rm -rf $TMPDIR/haste-map-*
  ```

## FAQ

### How do I update dependencies?

```bash
# Update all dependencies
npx npm-check-updates -u
npm install

# Or update a specific package
npm install package-name@latest
```

### How do I add a new dependency?

```bash
# For production dependencies
npm install package-name --save

# For development dependencies
npm install package-name --save-dev
```

### How do I debug the app?

#### iOS
- Open the project in Xcode and use the debugger
- Use the React Native Debugger: https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger

#### Android
- Use Android Studio's debugger
- Use Chrome Developer Tools: https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools

### How do I contribute translations?

1. Add or update strings in the appropriate language files in `src/translations/`
2. Update the translation keys in `src/translations/index.ts`
3. Submit a pull request with your changes
